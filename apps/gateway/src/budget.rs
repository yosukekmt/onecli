//! Budget layer — stub for the OSS build. All functions are no-ops; the cloud
//! build swaps this module for `cloud/budget.rs` via `#[path]` in `main.rs`.
//!
//! The shared types (`BudgetBinding`, `BudgetPeriod`) and `resolve_bindings` are
//! referenced by the shared `connect.rs`/`gateway/mitm.rs` threading, so they
//! exist in both builds with the same surface — inert in OSS
//! (`resolve_bindings` always returns an empty Vec, so the threaded field stays
//! empty and the cloud-only enforcement/metering in `cloud/hooks.rs` never runs).

// modules compiles per build (feature swap), so a field added to one and not the
// other will NOT fail compilation — the shared threading in `connect.rs`/
// `gateway/mitm.rs` just uses whichever copy is active. Treat them as one type.
